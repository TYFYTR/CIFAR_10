## What This Does

### **Ignores (LARGE files):**
- ✓ Model checkpoints (100MB-1GB each)
- ✓ Datasets (GB of images)
- ✓ Training logs (spam)
- ✓ Virtual environments (100s of MB)

### **Tracks (SMALL, important):**
- ✓ Your code (.py files)
- ✓ ML diary (JSON files, a few KB)
- ✓ README.md
- ✓ requirements.txt
- ✓ Config files

---

## Critical: NEVER commit these
```
# These will bloat your repo to GB
results/      # Model checkpoints
data/         # Raw datasets  
venv/         # Python packages
*.pth         # PyTorch model files
```

**If you accidentally commit, repo becomes unusable (too large).**

---

## What TO commit
```
src/          # Your code
ml_diary/     # Run snapshots (small JSON)
README.md     # Documentation
requirements.txt  # Dependencies
.gitignore    # This file
